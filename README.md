# SearchingStrategies
Try Recursive/Iterative &amp; Bidirectional/single-direction
Search for solutions connecting 2*2*2-Rubiks' Cube states.
In Cell class, set j < 2 (only rotate 1 face) for demo, j < 4 (fix 1 face) to test, or j < 6 (all 2*2*2-Rubik's Cube states) to simulate.
Consider drawing line charts (with different searchers having different colors) to visualize excessive data.
